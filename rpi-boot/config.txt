# There are two framebuffers when an SPI display is attached:
#
# - /dev/fb0 - represents the HDMI output. This output is hardware-accelerated
#              and therefore should be the target of GUIs
# - /dev/fb1 - represents the SPI/LCD output
#
# The following settings enable a custom mode (mode 87) that sets the HDMI
# output to the same resolution as the LCD. This is useful so an application
# can target the hardware-accelerated output, and the raspi2fb tool can be
# used to mirror the output to the LCD.
#
# The HDMI group forces DMT output even on the HDMI output. DMT is the
# standard for monitors, in contrast to CEA, the standard for TVs.
